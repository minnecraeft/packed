    Packed is a mod that adds a variety of storage blocks such as chest, barrels, and crates. These storage blocks all
    have different tiers, with each tier the blocks has the ability to store more items than the previous one.

<h2>Features:</h2>

    <dd>
        <p>The default vanilla chests has 27 slots for items, with this mod each the default tier has the same amount
            but it also offers additional tiers which each one can get 9 additional slots. <br>
            And of course, they can be combined into double chests.</p>

        <p>The barres are essentially the same thing as the chest but as barrels. They also exist in all wood varieties
            with the same upgrade mechanics.

    <dd>
        <p>Storage Crates can only contain one single item type. However it will store dozens of stacks of it.
            (Tier 1: 32 Stacks, Tier 2: 64 Stacks, Tier 3: 96 Stacks, Tier 4: 128 Stacks) <br>
            Left Clicking will extract 16 and sneaking will extract 64 Items at once. Right clicking it multiple times
            will insert all items in your inventory which match into the crate.

            The <em>storage upgrader</em> can upgrade every storage block from this mod in place, keeping the Inventory
            of course! (This does not work for double chests yet)
